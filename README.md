# Plastic Waste in the Ocean

The topic of my Explorative Information Visualization project is "Plastic Waste in the Ocean". It is related to Goal 14 of the UN SDGs: Converse and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. The goal is to share and tell about the dire situation the ocean life faces currently. There are more than one million seabirds and 100,000 marine animals die from plastic pollution annually. Furthermore, in the near future, the number of plastics in the sea is estimated to be higher than the number of fish.

The huge amount of plastic disrupts marine biodiversityâ€™s lives. It is absolutely critical to take care of this issue since marine biodiversity is important
for our planet and our health. This project will help raise awareness of the situation by providing the information with visualizations about the facts of the pollution and steps people can take to help the ocean.
